# GitHub Actions

A repository of utility GitHub actions config, which I can re-use in projects

## Should you use these for your own projects?

These actions are primarily built for my own projects. As a result, they are likely to change often. If something becomes stable and intended for others to use, I will extract it to a separate repository.

That said, this repository is versioned using Semantic Versioning, so even if I make breaking changes, the version you might be using will still be available.
